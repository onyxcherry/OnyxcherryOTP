# OnyxcherryOTP

## Flask (Python) app with two-factor authentication based on time - [One-Time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password).

### Features

* Sign in, register, reset password panels
* Fresh login requirement to crucial operations
* Reset password by email
* Activate and deactivate 2FA
* Two latest OTP are valid
* QR Code rendered at client-side (by a pure Javascript library)
* Easy translations with Flask-Babel
* Content Security Policy Level 3

#### Since client get only secret code (asynchronous), it is no need to deal with images and its caching by robots etc.

#### Two latest OTP are valid in order to transfer limits and to improve usability.

pyotp library allows to generate and check OTP at given time, e.g. for last 30 seconds:
 `totp.at(datetime.datetime.now()-timedelta(seconds=30))`

### Install

1. Clone this repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/onyxcherry/OnyxcherryOTP.git
```

2. Create and activate python virtual environment

``` bash
cd OnyxcherryOTP
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Compile translations

``` bash
flask translate compile
```

5. Create database

> This project uses sqlite3 by default for the convenience. You could use anything else.

``` bash
flask shell
```

``` python3
>>> db.create_all()
```

### Run

``` 
flask run
```

or - on production - use [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).

---
Whether or not development purpose, you have to run the app with https if you want to use Webauthn: 

1. Generate own self-signed SSL certs with [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) or [openssl](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self))
2. Run the app with https:

``` 
gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:5777:5777 --certfile /path/to/server.crt --keyfile /path/to/server.key --access-logfile - --error-logfile - --reload onyxcherryotp:app
```

### Docker

1. Build the image

``` 
docker build -t onyxcherryotp:commit_id -f Dockerfile .
```

2. Copy or create `.env` file, add or update variables, especialy `DATABASE_URL`
3. Run the database server, create a database and tables (by running migration scripts or `flask shell` and `db.create_all()`)
3. Run the container

``` 
docker run --name onyxcherryotp_commit_id_one -d -p 127.0.0.1:5333:5777 --mount type=bind,source=/path/outside/docker/to/config.py,destination=/home/onyxcherry/OnyxcherryOTP/config.py,readonly --mount type=bind,source=/path/outside/docker/to/.env,destination=/home/onyxcherry/OnyxcherryOTP/.env,readonly onyxcherryotp:commit_id
```

---

#### Note about environment variables:

Both Gunicorn (due to at least 2 workers) and multiple containers of Docker need to specify **same** environment variables, especially `SECRET_KEY` . Unless specified, you will have troubles with correctly cookies' sign.

Therefore use e.g

``` 
python -c 'from os import urandom; from base64 import b64encode; print(b64encode(urandom(32)).decode("utf-8"))'
```

and pass it as SECRET_KEY.  

**Update other variables**.

#### Running tests

``` 
pytest
```

(you might have typed `pip install -e .` )

---

OnyxcherryOTP uses SendGrid to sending emails. Set `MAIL_LOCALHOST=True` in the .env if you want to send emails to localhost.

If so type 

``` 

python3 -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:8465
```

in another console window.

### TO-DO:

* [x] Add `revoke other sessions` button
* [x] Add custom front-end (panels)
* [ ] Temporarily block user account due to security reasons (and verify & sign in through email)
* [ ] Add alternative way to 2FA authenticate (backup codes)
* [ ] Add WebAuthn
